          <p class="f5 f4-ns fw4 ma0 mb3">Hi. My name's Min Jun, but call me Eric. I'm probly just like you, with many dreams, goals, and aspirations.</p>
          <p class="f5 f4-ns fw4 ma0 mb3">I have a problem though, and that's motivation. Quotes by famous people have never really done it for me. Neither has reading thousands of blog posts on the subject. Nor fancy to-do lists or apps.</p>
          <p class="f5 f4-ns fw4 ma0 mb3">Hana is my attempt at solving, or at least alleviating this problem just a little bit.</p>
          <p class="f5 f4-ns fw4 ma0 mb3">It is my belief that nothing motivates better than reading your own heartfelt answers to key questions regarding your goal, along with your own words about the progress you've made thus far.</p>
          <p class="f5 f4-ns fw4 ma0">Give it a shot. Right now, in its bare form, Hana is completely free of charge. But stay tuned. I'm working on web and mobile apps to make things a lot more convenient and simple to use.</p>
